## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## My favorite applications: Instagram, RedBook, Facebook, YouTube
- Posting words or pictures to share my daily life or thoughts
- Taking pictures or videos and editing them into another video
- Watching videos or livestreams to learn
- Connecting with friends and family through direct messages or comments
- Discovering new content through recommendations, hashtags, or trending topics

## The app I want to build:
-  A movie recommendation app designed to help users discover the perfect movie for any mood, occasion, or preference. Features include personalized watchlists, the ability to filter by streaming platforms, a social component for sharing movie reviews or recommendations with friends.


Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- This is my first time building an app, so there are still many features for me to explore and learn. One challenge I encountered is getting familiar with the syntax of the code.
